    <h1>Independence Day</h1>
    
    <h2>History of Independence Day</h2>
    <p>Independence Day, celebrated annually on August 15th, marks a significant milestone in the history of India. It commemorates the day in 1947 when India finally achieved freedom from British colonial rule after nearly 200 years of struggle. 
The history of Independence Day is deeply intertwined with the broader struggle for freedom, which was characterized by widespread nationalistic movements, civil disobedience, and non-violent resistance led by prominent leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, and many others. The Indian independence movement began in the late 19th century with the formation of the Indian National Congress in 1885, which played a pivotal role in rallying the Indian masses against the injustices of British rule. 
Over the decades, numerous movements like the Swadeshi Movement, the Non-Cooperation Movement, the Civil Disobedience Movement, and the Quit India Movement gained momentum, uniting people from various regions, religions, and backgrounds in their quest for self-rule. 
The British government, under pressure from these sustained campaigns and global changes following World War II, finally decided to grant independence to India. On the midnight of August 14-15, 1947, India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, delivered his iconic "Tryst with Destiny" speech, heralding a new era of freedom and hope for the nation. 
However, this victory was bittersweet, as it also led to the Partition of India and Pakistan, resulting in widespread communal violence and mass migrations. Despite these challenges, Independence Day remains a powerful symbol of the resilience, unity, and determination of the Indian people.
 Every year, the day is marked by flag-hoisting ceremonies, cultural programs, and patriotic displays across the country, with the main event taking place at the Red Fort in Delhi, where the Prime Minister addresses the nation.
 The history of Independence Day is not just about the end of colonial rule, but also about the enduring spirit of freedom, democracy, and the ongoing efforts to build a just and equitable society.</p>
